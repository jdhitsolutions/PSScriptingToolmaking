# PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking

This repository contains the demos and scripts used in the PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking presentation given to the [Twin Cities Systems Management User Group](https://tcsmug.org/) on [15 April 2024](https://events.eventzilla.net/e/tcsmug-april-15th-meeting-2138605088). The session was not recorded.

## Demos

Open the `demo.ps1` script file in VSCode to follow along. All code should work in Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7 on a Windows platform. The custom formatting in the module demo will not render correctly in the Windows PowerShell ISE.

## Session Abstract

PowerShell is about enabling IT Pros to get more work done more efficiently and to meet constantly changing business requirements. In many cases, you can use one of the thousands of PowerShell commands to get the job done. But sometimes you need a new tool. Fortunately, you don't need to be a .NET developer to create one. Using PowerShell's scripting language you can build a re-usable PowerShell tool that you can put to work immediately. It doesn't matter if you are managing a file server, SharePoint, or Microsoft 365. If you can manage it with PowerShell you can build a tool. In this presentation, PowerShell MVP and expert Jeff Hicks will demonstrate the process of building a PowerShell tool from a set of console commands to a shareable module.
